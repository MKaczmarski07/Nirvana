## Technological facilities üõ†Ô∏è
- Application is based on Angular 15. Navigation is handled using built-in RouterModule. To facilitate communication between components I have used Angular's EventEmitters and @Input/@Output decorators. Additionally, I have immplemented  two-way data binding using Angular's FormsModule. 
- Since the project is strictly frontend, the data is stored in the browser's local storage.
- UI is mainly done with the TailwindCSS framework and regular CSS.
