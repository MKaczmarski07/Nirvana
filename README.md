## Technological facilities 🛠️
- Application is based on Angular 15. Navigation is handled using built-in RouterModule. To facilitate communication between components I have used Angular's EventEmitters and @Input/@Output decorators.
- Two-way data binding is handled using Angular's FormsModule. 
- Since the project is strictly frontend, the data is stored in the browser's local storage.
- UI is mainly done with the TailwindCSS framework, CSS and Material UI.

## Installation Guide ⚙️
This project is based on Angular framework and uses TailwindCSS and MaterialUI libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with the project.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14.0 or later)
- npm package manager (version 6.0 or later)

### Installation
Let's start with installing all dependencies. Move to the app main workspace and run:

    npm i

To create a localhost port you should type:

    ng serve

Your application is ready at port 4200.

    http://localhost:4200/
